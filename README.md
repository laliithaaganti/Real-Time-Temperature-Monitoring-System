# Real-Time Temperature Monitoring System Using DHT Sensor

This project presents a real-time environmental monitoring system developed to measure and display critical environmental parameters on an OLED display using a DHT11 sensor and an Arduino Uno.

## 📋 Project Overview
The system provides immediate feedback on ambient conditions, making it ideal for environments like greenhouses, server rooms, and laboratories where precise control is essential[cite: 104, 125]. [cite_start]It tracks temperature, humidity, and the perceived heat index in real-time.

## 🛠️ Components Utilized
* **Arduino Uno**: The central microcontroller (ATmega328P) used for processing sensor data.
* **DHT11 Sensor**: A digital sensor used for sensing both temperature and humidity.
* **OLED Display (I2C)**: A thin, power-efficient display used for crisp visuals of the data.
* **AC/DC Adapter (12V)**: Used to provide steady power to the Arduino board.
* **Connecting Cables**: Used for interfacing the sensors and display with the microcontroller.



## 📊 Parameters Evaluated
* **Temperature**: Measured and displayed in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* **Humidity**: Tracked to monitor moisture content in the environment.
* **Heat Index**: Calculated to assess the perceived temperature based on humidity and heat.

## 🚀 Applications
1. **Climate Monitoring**: Tracking indoor temperature and humidity.
2. **HVAC Control**: Controlling ventilation systems based on environmental data.
3. **Agriculture**: Maintaining optimal conditions for plant growth in greenhouses.
4. **IT Infrastructure**: Preventing equipment overheating in server rooms.
5. **Laboratory Use**: Ensuring stable environments for sensitive experiments.

## 🔮 Future Scope
* Integration of wireless communication for remote monitoring.
* Implementation of data logging for long-term environmental analysis.
* Development of advanced IoT applications and smart home systems.
